# Philipp Mayorov's Portfolio 🌐✨

Welcome to my digital playground! 🚀 I’m **Philipp Mayorov**, a **Software Engineer** and **AI startup founder** passionate about building immersive experiences that merge design, intelligence, and technology. This portfolio is a window into my creative and technical journey from hackthon projects to launching real-world AI applications.

## 🎨 About Me

I’m currently pursuing my **Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Western University (GPA: 3.7)**, where I’ve cultivated a strong foundation in **data structures, machine learning, and software design**. Beyond the classroom, I thrive at the intersection of **art, code, and innovation**.

As **Co-Founder and CEO of [AI Backlinker](https://aibacklinker.io)**, I built a **profitable SaaS startup ($1,000+ MRR)** that leverages **AI-driven matching algorithms** to help businesses rank higher on Google. By combining full-stack development with user-centered design, I improved client onboarding conversion rates by **67% in just two weeks**.

Previously, I worked as a **Data Engineer at Tayco**, where I streamlined furniture production workflows and built data communication platforms that improved operational efficiency by **200%**.

When I’m not coding, I’m designing 3D experiences that bring ideas to life — blending art and engineering to make technology feel intuitive, interactive, and alive.
